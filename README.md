### How Yolo Group deals with failure

I started working as tech lead for the Onboarding team at Yolo Group last month.

You might be familiar with some of their products; Bombay Casino, Sportsbet.io, Bitcasino.io or Slots.io. Actually, I hope for your sake you're not, because they're all nothing but the worst kind of trash entertainment.

Along the way my leaders in the organisation repeatedly failed to show any interest in understanding or solving problems and helping out when it didn't directly benefit them directly.

Because of this I informed them that I wouldn't be extending my 4 month contract, but wouldn't mind to keep doing an excellent job until then to ease the transition and cause minimal disruption. God knows they could use whatever professional help they can get in structuring their internal processes.

In return for this favor, they fired me on the spot. Cut my contract short without compensation and caused chaos and confusion in the team I was leading as well as for the people in the organisation depending on our services.

It seems to me like personal power trips and short sighted profits are more important than the company's reputation and the wellbeing of their employees to managers in Yolo Group.

Consider yourself warned; this is not the kind of company you want anything to do with, neither as an employee nor customer.
