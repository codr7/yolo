### Working at Yolo Group

I joined Yolo group as tech lead for the Onboarding team last month.

You might be familiar with some of their products; such as Bombay Casino, Sportsbet.io, Bitcasino.io and Slots.io.

People say I should have known what was waiting, but I didn't; I figured laws applied even to online casinos and there would be good people working there as well. So I'm sharing my story to at least allow people to make informed choices and prevent the company from playing their dirty game with more innocent lives.

It quickly became obvious that my leaders and representatives in the organisation had little interest in understanding or solving problems and helping out when it didn't benefit them directly. Since this behavior defined the outer limits of my ability to help my team, I concluded it would be impossible for me to do my job the way I wanted to.

Because of this I informed my manager that I wouldn't be extending my 4 month contract, but that I would still like to fulfill the contract to ease the transition and cause minimal disruption. In return for this favor, and as a thank you for the excellent work I'd done thus far; they fired me on the spot. Cut my contract short without compensation, causing unnecessary chaos and confusion in the team as well as for people in the organisation depending on our services.

It seems to me like management in Yolo Group is more focused on personal power trips and covering up their own mistakes than the success of the company and wellbeing of their employees. 

I still haven't received a pay check for the work I did, and I don't at all look forward to having go the legal route to force them to fullfill their obligations. Everyone I've spoken to, from HR to managers to legal representatives, keeps making excuses and coming up with new rules and things I have to do to get paid.

If you want to learn more about what kind of company Yolo Group is, I recommend the comments on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eesti/comments/1l4s2l0/how_yolo_group_deals_with_failure/) Reddit post.

Consider yourself warned; this is not the kind of company you want anything to do with.

Any assistance with spreading the word is most appreciated, help me hold these scumbags accountable for once!
