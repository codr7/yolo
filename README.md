### How Yolo Group deals with failure

I joined Yolo group as tech lead for the Onboarding team last month.

You might be familiar with some of their products; such as Bombay Casino, Sportsbet.io, Bitcasino.io and Slots.io.

It quickly became obvious that my leaders and representatives in the organisation had little interest in understanding or solving problems and helping out when it didn't benefit them directly.

Because of this I informed my manager that I wouldn't be extending my 4 month contract, but that I would still like to fulfill the contract to ease the transition and cause minimal disruption.

In return for this favor, and as a thank you for the excellent work I've done so far; they fired me on the spot, cut my contract short without compensation; and thereby caused unnecessary chaos and confusion in the team I was leading as well as for the people in the organisation depending on our services.

It seems to me like management in Yolo Group is more focused on personal power trips and covering up their own mistakes than the success of the company and wellbeing of their employees.

Consider yourself warned; this is not the kind of company you want anything to do with.
