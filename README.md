### How Yolo Group deals with failure

I started working as tech lead for the Onboarding team at Yolo Group last month.

You might be familiar with some of their products; Bombay Casino, Sportsbet.io, Bitcasino.io and Slots.io.

Along the way my leaders and representatives in the organisation repeatedly failed to show any interest in understanding or solving problems and helping out when it didn't benefit them directly.

Because of this I informed my manager that I wouldn't be extending my 4 month contract, and that I wouldn't mind keep doing my job until then to ease the transition and cause minimal disruption.

In return for this favor, they fired me on the spot, cut my contract short without compensation; and thereby caused unnecessary chaos and confusion in the team I was leading as well as for the people in the organisation depending on our services.

It seems to me like management at Yolo Group is more focused on power trips and covering up their own mistakes than the success of the company and the wellbeing of their employees.

Consider yourself warned; this is not the kind of company you want anything to do with, neither as an employee nor customer.
